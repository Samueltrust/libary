When x is clicked
we select a random number from 0 - 1
if the number is between (1/2 == rock) or (2/3 == scissors) or (1/kl == paper)
if user input and computer input is the same i.e on rock or better or worse
create wins, losses and ties and update accordingly
we print x
and print you = ... computer = ...
